# Welcome to My Project 🎉

This is a **Next.js** project I built using [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). If you enjoy experimenting and want to see what I’ve been working on, you’re in the right place!

## Getting Started 🚀

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev    # If you use npm
yarn dev       # If you prefer Yarn
pnpm dev       # For PNPM fans
bun dev        # If you're into Bun

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. And that’s it! 🚀
